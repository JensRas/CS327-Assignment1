# Assignment 1 

COM 327 - Advanced Programming @ Iowa State University - Assignment 1 - Roguelike.

Roguelike game. Generate a dungeon. Write dungeons to disc and read them back. Calculate shortest paths from all points in the dungeon to the PC (player character). Add the PC and randomly generated NPCs to the dungeon. Add a curses interface to the game. The PC and NPC structures must be changed to classes. Given a specification for monster and object descriptions, you will implement a parser to load these descriptions into the game. Use the parsed monster and object descriptions to load monsters and objects into the game. Implement object pick up and equipment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

A series of steps to clone the code.

Step 1:
Accessing a shell.
 - Oracle VM VirtualBox. 
 - Pyrite.
 - Cygwin - make sure gcc and other relevant packages are included.

Step 2:
Download Github Desktop and setup with a personal access token.
 - This makes pushing, cloning, and pulling incredibly easy. 
 - You might still need git bash not sure. 
 
Step 3:
Clone the Repository.
 - Straightforward if you have Github desktop.

Step 4:
Final.
 - If you did everything correctly, you should be able to see the updated files for Assignment 1.

## Running the tests

Simply compile the program using gcc -Wall assignment1.c -o assignment1 and run using ./assignment1.
or
Use the make file.
